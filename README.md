If your user.js daemon is working properly, you should be able to install the eSix Thumb Enhancer by opening [this link](https://github.com/SuscipiamSingularitatem/e6ThumbEnhancer-UserJS/raw/master/e6te.user.js), and autoupdates should also work.  
If you've never used user.js before, I recommend installing [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/).
